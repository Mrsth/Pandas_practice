# Pandas_practice

<h1>Welcome to my Pandas practice</h1>

<p>In this repository, I have stored all the practices that I have done in pandas including some data analysis as well.</p>

<h2>What is pandas?</h2>
<p>Pandas is a very useful library developed by Wes McKinney for munging and manipulating the data. The data structure in which pandas represents the data
is called a dataframe. It is a combination of rows or columns lets say. But more preciesly in terms of pandas, a dataframe is a collection of series. Now 
what is a series then?
</p>

<h2>What is series?</h2>
<p>A series is just like dataframe but having only one dimension. So can a dataframe be of 1D? Yes if it contains only one series.</p>

<h2>What is EDA?</h2>
<p>EDA stands for explainatory data analysis. It is a process of cleaning, manipulating, representating data in suitable format for extracting the hidden information
and patterns for decision making. In short, it is a process of making sense of any data visually and in terms of decision making.</p>
